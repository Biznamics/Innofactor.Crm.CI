    The packaging gate: assertions against a built .vsix.

    Every regression this repo has actually shipped would have been caught
    here - DotNetZip riding along in stale bin output, ADAL about to flip
    version, a task missing its cmdlet, screenshots not packaged.

    Pass a specific package with:
        Invoke-Pester ./tests/Vsix.Tests.ps1 -Data @{ VsixPath = 'path/to.vsix' }
    Otherwise the newest .vsix under Extension/VSIX is used.
#>

param(
    [string] $VsixPath
)

BeforeDiscovery {
    . $PSScriptRoot/TestHelpers.ps1
    # -Skip is evaluated during discovery, so the package has to be located here.
    $HaveVsix = [bool](Resolve-VsixPath -VsixPath $VsixPath)
}
